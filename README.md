## 🧠 About the Project
This project analyzes PhonePe's transaction data to track key performance metrics across its four main services: **Insurance, Loans, Money Transfers, and Recharge & Bills**. 

The main goal is to provide a clear, interactive dashboard for stakeholders to understand transaction trends, identify reasons for failed payments, and make data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
* Develop a 5-page dashboard to track and summarize performance.
* Identify business risks by creating a dedicated **Failed Payments Analysis** dashboard to visualize failure reasons (e.g., server errors, insufficient balance).
* Enable granular decision-making with interactive slicers for real-time data filtering by **date and service**.
* Create a user-friendly and intuitive navigation experience using the official PhonePe brand theme, custom visuals, and buttons.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **Power BI:** Data modeling, DAX, visualization, and dashboard creation.
* **Excel:** The data source (XLSX).

## 🔍 Key Insights & Conclusions
* **Failed Payment Risks:** The Failed Payments dashboard successfully identified that "Insufficient Balance" and "Server Errors" are the top two reasons for transaction failures, pointing to a need for user-side notifications and backend infrastructure review.
* **Service Performance:** Money Transfers account for the highest transaction volume, but "Recharge & Bills" has the most frequent user interaction.
* **Seasonal Trends:** The date slicer revealed that transaction volumes (especially for recharges) peak significantly during the last 3 days of each month.
